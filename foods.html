        <h1>Delicious Indian Foods</h1>
        <div class="food-item">
            <h2>Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani)</h2>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/35/38/72/353872fff386a82d3d9378ed70762e9a.jpg" alt="Butter Chicken">
            <p>Originating from Delhi, this is a rich and creamy tomato-based chicken curry. The chicken is first marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked in a buttery, mildly spiced gravy made with tomatoes, cream, and cashews. It has a slightly sweet and smoky flavor, making it one of the most loved Indian dishes worldwide. It's typically eaten with butter naan or basmati rice.</p>   
        </div>

        <div class="food-item">
            <h2>Chicken Biryani</h2>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/6a/cc/f3/6accf3cefbe7f9779d151e3696018990.jpg" alt="Chicken Biryani">
            <p>A fragrant rice dish made by layering long-grain basmati rice with spiced meat (usually chicken, mutton, or beef) or vegetables. It’s slow-cooked with saffron, fried onions, and a blend of warming spices like cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. Each region has its twist — Hyderabadi biryani is dum-cooked with yogurt and fried onions, while Lucknowi (Awadhi) biryani is milder and aromatic. It’s often served with raita (yogurt dip) and boiled eggs. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="food-item">
            <h2>Masala Dosa</h2>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a5/34/bf/a534bf19d78bd06033d34a5578056070.jpg" alt="Masala Dosa">
            <p>A beloved South Indian dish, masala dosa is a large, paper-thin crepe made from a fermented rice and urad dal (black lentil) batter. It’s crisp on the outside and soft inside, filled with a savory mashed potato filling seasoned with mustard seeds, turmeric, and curry leaves. It’s served with coconut chutney and a spicy lentil soup called sambar. Crunchy, tangy, spicy, and comforting — all in one bite. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="food-item">
            <h2>Paneer Tikka</h2>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e1/a5/91/e1a59105bff129316df8c082826939c9.jpg" alt="Paneer Tikka">
            <p>A popular vegetarian appetizer made from chunks of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) marinated in a mix of yogurt and spices like garam masala, chili powder, and turmeric. The pieces are then skewered with onions and bell peppers and grilled or roasted until charred. It's served with mint chutney and sometimes wrapped in naan as a paneer tikka roll.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="food-item">
            <h2>Chole Bhature</h2>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f5/9c/9a/f59c9a7f63c2cd4bd587f3de73f184a4.jpg" alt="Chole Bhature">
            <p>A power combo of spicy chickpea curry (chole) and deep-fried puffed bread (bhature). It’s hearty, bold in flavor, and filling — commonly eaten for breakfast or lunch in North India. The chole is cooked with onions, tomatoes, and a special blend of spices, while the bhature is soft inside and crispy on the outside. Often served with pickles, onions, and a glass of lassi. </p>
